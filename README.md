# cs210_termProject

Hello! In my project I processed my data in Google Maps in between 12/2015 - 12/2023. This project is for my course of Introduction to Data Science and it includes various techniques of exploratory data analysis, data visualization and a prediction model trained to predict the missing values for a part of the data. To run the code, **please use "run all" button (or equivalent of it, depending on your IDE), if you want to run the cells one by one, please respect the order of the cells.**

The .zip file includes 3 objects: a physical map photo (which was referenced inside the code file), the .json file for my personal data, and the code script as a notebook file to process that data. Additionally, outside of the zip, there are a presentation report to elaborate further on the project's purposes and workflow and the readme file that you are reading right now. In the code file, there are various cells with a specific order. Firstly, data was preprocessed, then analyzed and visualized for exploratory data analysis, and finally used to train a model for demonstration of ML usage. There are additional reviews and comments on the charts and results in the presentation file and the notebook file, you can also check them out.

I used Python 3.11.4 while writing the code script and there are some modules that I used in code, which are imported at the beginning, such as numpy, matplotlib and GridSearchCV.
