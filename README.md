Hello! In my project I processed my data in Google Maps in between 12/2015 - 12/2023. This project is for my course of Introduction to Data Science and it includes various techniques of exploratory data analysis, data visualization and a prediction model trained to predict the missing values for a part of the data. To run the code, **please use "run all" button (or equivalent of it, depending on your IDE), if you want to run the cells one by one, please respect the order of the cells.**

The .zip file includes 4 objects: a physical map photo (which was referenced inside the code file), the .json file for my personal data, the code script as a notebook file to process that data and a presentation report to elaborate further on the project's purposes and workflow. In the code file, there are various cells with a specific order. Firstly, data was preprocessed, then analyzed and visualized for exploratory data analysis, and finally used to train a model for demonstration of ML usage. There are additional reviews and comments on the charts and results in the notebook file, you can also check them out.
